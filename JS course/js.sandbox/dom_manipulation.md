#### DOM
- Document Object Model
- Tree of nodes/elements created by the browser
- JS can be used to read/write/manipulate to the DOM
- Object Oriented Representation means that each elememts have own properties and methods that can be change.

DOM is a representation of html document. It can be thought of kind of as a tree of nodes or elements created by the browser.

#### Examing the document object 

Window object is basically a global object of the browser environmet and document is a property of that window object.

#### DOM Selectors

Types: single element and multiple elements. Single elements allow to take one element (the first one) by it`s ID or it's class. Multiple elements sselectors will get all of the elements with that class and then return in html collection or element list depending on which selector you use.

`document.querySelector()` works like jquery you can put in any css selector.

#### Traversing the DOM

Traversing the DOM means move up and down.
