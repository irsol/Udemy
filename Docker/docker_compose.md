Wich Docker Compose you just creat docker-compose.yml file. It is a tool for defining and running multi container Docker apps. With docker-compose.yml file you configure applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration. This is helpful tool for development and production.

# Create docker-compose.yml

2. define services property:
   `services: 
   	  redis:
   	    image: `redis:5.0.4-alpine` `

   	 `web: '.'` 
   	 could be any name, but the service name that choose here will be used in Docker Image and Container names. '.' means current directory.
